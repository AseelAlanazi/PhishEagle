<h1>ML-Based-Phishing-Detection(PhishEagle)</h1>
<h3>🚀 Project Summary</h3>
<p>We have developed a “PhishEagle” phishing detection system using a 
<strong>random forest (RF) model</strong>.<br> 
The model has been trained on significant<strong> Mendeley 
datasets_2020 </strong>,and has demonstrated considerable advantages in accurately detecting 
phishing attempts.<br>
By analysing the critical features of the site's URL, the system can 
distinguish between legitimate and malicious sites.<br>
Our comprehensive evaluation showed 
a <strong>high 99.4% accuracy </strong>and makes it a reliable tool for phishing detection.
<br>We have integrated <strong>“PhishEagle” into Chrome's web extension</strong> ,allowing real-time detection and 
improving user protection</p>

<h4>To Run the program:</h4>
