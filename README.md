<h1>Phishing Detection Extension -PhishEagle</h1>
<h3>🚀 Project Summary</h3>
<p>We have developed a “PhishEagle” phishing detection system using a 
random forest (RF) mode.<br> 
The model has been trained on significant Mendeley 
datasets_2020 ,and has demonstrated considerable advantages in accurately detecting 
phishing attempts.<br>
By analysing the critical features of the site's URL, the system can 
distinguish between legitimate and malicious sites.<br>
Our comprehensive evaluation showed 
a high 99.4% accuracy and makes it a reliable tool for phishing detection.
<br>We have integrated “PhishEagle” into Chrome's web extension, allowing real-time detection and 
improving user protection</p>
