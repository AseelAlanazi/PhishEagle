<h1>Phishing Detection Extension -PhishEagle<h1>
<p>We have developed a “PhishEagle” phishing detection system using a 
random forest (RF) model. The model has been trained on significant Mendeley 
datasets_2020 and has demonstrated considerable advantages in accurately detecting 
phishing attempts. By analysing the critical features of the site's URL, the system can 
distinguish between legitimate and malicious sites. Our comprehensive evaluation showed 
a high 99.4% accuracy and makes it a reliable tool for phishing detection. We have 
integrated “PhishEagle” into Chrome's web extension, allowing real-time detection and 
improving user protection<p>
